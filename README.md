# SF Allocator

SF Allocator is a header-only general purpose allocator written in C and is meant
to be both transparent and performant. It ships with common memory operator utilities
like `memset`, `memcpy`, and `memzero`. The allocator is designed to be easy to
drop in while also providing more advanced features such as low-overhead allocation
routines and large allocations.

# Documentation

Currently, SFA is an in-progress library. Documentation is currently only available
in-source. The source code does contain a pretty good amount of helpful information,
however, and if you intend to use this in your projects, I would recommend skimming
the source code to get an idea of what the allocator is doing.
